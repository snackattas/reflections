What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	they help you see how code paths diverge, and which ones are reachable or throwaway, or if it'll be hard to recombine
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?
	Merging 2 branches looks at the original parent branch before the divergence.  If lines were added in either branch, 
	are preserved. If lines were removed in either branch (from the origin), they are removed.

manually?
